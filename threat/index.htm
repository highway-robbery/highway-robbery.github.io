          <p class="hd">About RS 2477:<br>
          A Monumental Threat to Our Natural Treasures </p>
          <p class="reg">Across the West, state and local governments are 
          getting ready to file thousands of unsubstantiated claims for federal 
          rights-of-way under the provisions of an 1866 mining law known as RS 
          (Revised Statute) 2477. Repealed by Congress in 1976, this law was 
          originally intended to serve the narrow goal of granting the right to 
          construct and use highways across public lands <i>that were not 
          otherwise reserved or set aside for other public uses</i> (such as to 
          protect water supplies, forests, wildlife, or scenic beauty). Instead, 
          it is now viewed as a loophole to allow the bulldozing of a spider web 
          of roads across some of our most scenic and valued national parks and 
          refuges. </p>
          <p class="reg">The great majority of these phantom-road claims are 
          illegitimate assertions meant to undermine federal protected areas, 
          thwart wilderness protection (because the presence of a road generally 
          disqualifies an area for wilderness designation), and serve special 
          interests, such as mining, timber, and oil and gas industries, and 
          off-road-vehicle users. Some counties are asserting RS 2477 
          road-building rights-of-way claims for cow paths, horse trails, 
          riverbeds, off-road vehicle routes, and for overgrown trails that have 
          not been maintained or driven on for decades, if ever. </p>
          <p class="reg">Although many of these claims are obviously bogus, the 
          threats are all too real. The unmanaged and unnecessary creation of 
          new roads in pristine areas would degrade water quality, destroy and 
          fragment wildlife habitat, increase the risk of vandalism to 
          archeological sites, encourage the destructive use of off-road 
          vehicles outside of designated-use areas, increase erosion, destroy 
          the peace and quiet of wild areas, and undermine conservation efforts 
          for lands that are meant to be preserved for future generations. This 
          long-outdated statute would allow special interests to bulldoze 
          highways, utility corridors, and pipelines into our most precious 
          parks and refuges and threatens to have a lasting and devastating 
          impact on America’s Western public lands. </p>
          <p class="reg">The largest emerging threat posed is a new rule adopted 
          by the Interior Department that makes giveaways and bulldozing under 
          RS 2477 easier. Learn more about the <a href="disclaimer.htm">

          2005: Forest Service Steps Back from Proposal to Open the Door to 
          Damaging Highway Claims</span></p>
          <p class="reg">On July 15, 2004, the Forest Service issued a draft 
          rule to help the agency get a handle on off-road vehicle use on its 
          190 million acres. Buried in the proposal were provisions that would 
          allow Forest Service staff to effectively recognize potentially 
          damaging RS 2477 rights-of-way without public input, notice, or 
          environmental review.
          <a href="../documents/Draft_ORV_Rule_7_15_04.pdf">Read the proposed 
          rule. </a></p>
          <p class="reg">The proposal to permit the Forest Service to 
          “ascertain” ownership of rights-of-way violates a congressional ban on 
          rulemakings pertaining to RS 2477, overturns an agency moratorium on 
          processing RS 2477 claims, and would permit the agency to revert to 
          guidance that defines rights-of-way in an illegally broad manner. As 
          the regulation is drafted, it would also likely result in the Forest 
          Service's abdicating its responsibility to protect forest resources 
          from damaging vehicle use. In short, the FS proposal to permit the FS 
          staff to “ascertain” whether RS 2477 right-of-way claims are valid is 
          poor policy and threatens public resources.
