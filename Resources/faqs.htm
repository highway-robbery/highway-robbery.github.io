          <p class="reg"><b><a name="faq1"></a>What rule change was made on 
          January 6, 2003? </b></p>
          <p class="reg">The Department of the Interior (DOI) has made changes 
          to federal regulations regarding “recordable disclaimers” of interests 
          in lands. The regulations generally permit the US government to issue 
          a document renouncing any interest in a particular piece of land when 
          the US government has no valid claim to such land. </p>
          <p class="reg">The changes to the rule relate to whether states, 
          counties and local governments can benefit from such disclaimers, even 
          when they aren’t recorded as owners of any land at issue. The changes 
          also permit states and local governments to ignore a 
          statute-of-limitations requirement that applies to all other property 
          owners. </p>
          <p class="small">[<a href="#top"><font color="#800000">Back to top</font></a>]</p>
          <p class="reg"><b><a name="faq2"></a>Is this a minor change, as BLM 
          contends? Why not? </b></p>
          <p class="reg">This is a MAJOR change. Through this rule change, the 
          administration is trying to make it easier for the DOI to hand over to 
          local governments rights-of-way to cow paths, horse trails, 
          river-beds, and dirt bike and off-road vehicle routes that criss-cross 
          public lands, including National Parks, across much of the West and in 
          Alaska, using an ancient mining law known as RS 2477. These paths, 
          trails and routes could then be bulldozed, made into paved highways or 
          otherwise. </p>
          <p class="reg">The effect of granting these rights-of-way through the 
          rule change is that much of our public lands in the West and in Alaska 
          may no longer qualify for permanent protection as wilderness, and our 
          National Parks could be impacted by significant road-related 
          development. Road and highway development on these “roads to nowhere” 
          will destroy and fragment wildlife habitat, cause erosion, degrade 
          water quality, spread weeds, and harm archeological sites. Previous 
          reports by the National Park Service have concluded that the impacts 
          of RS 2477 on Parks “could be devastating,” and found that granting 
          such claims “would undoubtedly degradate most [Park] values and 
          seriously impact the ability of the [National Park System] to manage 
          the [Parks] for the purposes for which they were established.” </p>
          <p class="reg">Places at risk where local governments have made claims 
          based on RS 2477 to roads to nowhere include: Denali National Park 
          (AK); Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (UT); Mojave 
          National Park (CA); and Canyonlands National Park (UT). </p>
          <p class="small">[<a href="#top"><font color="#800000">Back to top</font></a>]</p>
          <p class="reg"><b><a name="faq3"></a>Has DOI ever before used this 
          procedure to address RS 2477 before? </b></p>
          <p class="reg">NO. While the law permitting DOI to issue disclaimers 
          was issued more than 25 years ago, this rule change is the FIRST time 
          that DOI has ever stated that the disclaimer rule could be used to 
          surrender the public lands for development under RS 2477. </p>
          <p class="small">[<a href="#top"><font color="#800000">Back to top</font></a>]</p>
          <p class="reg"><b><a name="faq4"></a>What lands are affected by the 
          rule change? </b></p>
          <p class="reg">DOI asserts that the rule applies to ALL Federal lands 
          – including lands managed as National Parks, National Forests, 
          National Wildlife Refuges, wilderness areas, National Recreation 
          Areas, and even military bases and training areas. These lands total 
          hundreds of million acres. </p>
          <p class="small">[<a href="#top"><font color="#800000">Back to top</font></a>]</p>
          <p class="reg"><b><a name="faq5"></a>Will the Federal government 
          analyze the impacts of surrendering sensitive lands to local 
          governments for highway development before it gives up the 
          right-of-way? </b></p>
          <p class="reg">NO. DOI makes clear in the rule that it will NOT 
          analyze the environmental effects of either: (a) this rule change; or 
          (b) ANY decision to hand over the right to develop an individual “road 
          to nowhere,” no matter how sensitive the lands the route crosses. </p>
          <p class="small">[<a href="#top"><font color="#800000">Back to top</font></a>]</p>
          <p class="reg"><b><a name="faq6"></a>Isn’t it hyperbole to state that 
          there are an avalanche of road projects that will be unleashed by the 
          decision? </b></p>
          <p class="reg">No. Counties and states are poised to press thousands 
          and thousands of these claims. The State of Utah sent a letter to DOI 
          in 2000 claiming more than 10,000 individual routes across public 
          lands. The State of Alaska has already identified more than 650 
          right-of-way claims. The new rules will mean that it can request 
          “disclaimers” on some or all of them. In addition, in comments on the 
          rule change, San Bernardino County (CA) expressed concern about 
          bearing the cost of processing multiple RS 2477 claims through the 
          disclaimer rule “because the number of claims the county might 
          potentially file could create a financial burden” on them. This from a 
          county with a 2003 budget of $2 billion+ budget; which includes $161 
          million for public works. Gilpin County (CO) and Valley County (ID) 
          also expressed concerns about how DOI would address cost issues when 
          counties submitted multiple claims. </p>
          <p class="small">[<a href="#top"><font color="#800000">Back to top</font></a>]</p>
          <p class="reg"><b><a name="faq7"></a>Why is this proposal different 
          from the RS 2477 resolution proposed by Secretary Babbitt in 1994? </b>
          </p>
          <p class="reg">Secretary Babbitt’s proposed rule would have set clear, 
          concise standards for determining when a state or local government has 
          obtained a right to use a specific route. The disclaimer rule sets no 
          such standards. DOI Deputy Secretary Steven Griles told Alaska 
          industry officials that the Department would use standards that 
          pre-dated even the lax standards of James Watt’s tenure as DOI 
          Secretary. </p>
          <p class="reg">Secretary Babbitt’s proposed rule permitted any 
          affected person to appeal to the Bureau of Land Management any 
          decision on a particular route. DOI says that the disclaimer rule 
          permits only “applicants or claimants” to the land, not the concerned 
          public, may appeal. </p>
          <p class="small">[<a href="#top"><font color="#800000">Back to top</font></a>]</p>
          <p class="reg"><b><a name="faq8"></a>Isn't this proposal a good way to 
          reduce litigation and involve the public? </b></p>
          <p class="reg">While the public may comment on a decision to disclaim 
          interest in lands, the process of determining whether a valid 
          right-of-way exists is not open to the public. The DOI says that the 
          public will have no chance to appeal right-of-way and disclaimer 
          decisions; court action will be the only way to challenge decisions 
          degrading sensitive lands. </p>
          <p class="small">[<a href="#top"><font color="#800000">Back to top</font></a>]</p>
          <p class="reg"><b><a name="faq9"></a>Is this rule change legal? </b>
          </p>
          <p class="reg">No. In 1997, Congress prohibited DOI from issuing final 
          rules related to RS 2477; the General Accounting Office (as well as 
          DOI previously) concluded that this prohibition was permanent. In 
          addition, Congress did not intend for DOI to use the disclaimer rule 
          to be used to address RS 2477 rights-of-way when it passed the Federal 
          Land Policy and Management Act in 1976. The rule is inconsistent with 
          current law because it permits counties and local governments to avoid 
          the 12-year statute of limitations on filing claims to roads to 
          nowhere.</td>
