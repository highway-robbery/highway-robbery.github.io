          <p class="reg">Washington, DC -- A coalition of conservation groups 
          strongly criticized a new agreement between the Interior Department 
          and the state of Utah over a controversial road rule that provides a 
          loophole for giving away public lands in the state of Utah and across 
          the west to special interests. More than two years of secret, 
          closed-door negotiations between the State of Utah and the Department 
          of Interior have resulted in a memorandum of understanding 
          establishing a process by which road rights-of-ways will be recognized 
          on federal lands using a loophole – known as RS 2477 – in an outdated 
          mining law.</p>
          <p class="reg">“This agreement may look harmless on the surface, but 
          there is a bulldozer behind the fine print,” said Heidi McIntosh, 
          conservation director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, noting 
          that it leaves unprotected nearly 6 million acres of sensitive, 
          roadless Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands and about 4 million 
          acres of Forest Service roadless lands – an area roughly the size of 
          the states of Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. </p>
          <p class="reg">“While being touted as a compromise, the process set 
          forth in the agreement would actually roll back existing law and 
          weaken the criteria the BLM has used to evaluate claims,” McIntosh 
          said. “In reality, the Governor is aiming to use this agreement as a 
          tool to prevent any proposed wilderness areas from receiving permanent 
          protection. Ultimately, this is part of a sweeping attack on America’s 
          last remaining wilderness lands and comes on the heels of a lawsuit 
          filed by the state of Utah attacking the BLM’s authority to identify 
          and protect wilderness lands.” </p>
          <p class="reg">Less than three weeks ago, State of Utah filed a 
          complaint in federal court that seeks to make it impossible for the 
          BLM to ever again recommend areas for wilderness protection, or even 
          examine the agency’s lands for wilderness character. The BLM manages 
          more federal public lands than any other agency.</p>
          <p class="reg">The agreement also: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            <p class="reg">provides for no public involvement until after BLM 
            has made a decision to turn routes on public lands over to states;
            </li>
            <li>
            <p class="reg">will permit Utah to turn jeep tracks into paved 
            highways after simply notifying the BLM and getting the agency’s 
            approval, again without public involvement; </li>
            <li>
            <p class="reg">does not require any look at the environmental 
            impacts of the wholesale give-away of routes; </li>
            <li>
            <p class="reg">will use the Bush administration’s new, 
            controversial, and illegal ‘disclaimer rule’ to ease the public land 
            give-away; </li>
            <li>
            <p class="reg">provides no real protection for National Parks, 
            Wildlife Refuges or Wilderness areas, since the state of Utah, 
            counties, and all-terrain vehicle groups are free to pursue these 
            claims in federal court; </li>
            <li>
            <p class="reg">apparently will use loosen standards that could 
            permit states to allege that cow paths and foot trails are 
            “constructed highways” and thus subject to give away; and </li>
            <li>
            <p class="reg">invites other states and counties to apply for 
            similar agreements. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="reg">“This agreement will make it easy for the state of Utah 
          to wreck the wilderness future of the state, while leaving the door 
          open for others to go after the National Parks, Wildlife Refuges and 
          existing wilderness later. There’s no real protection here for 
          anything,” said Ted Zukoski, an attorney with Earthjustice. “America’s 
          public lands will be given away with no meaningful public involvement, 
          and no environmental review. And Secretary Norton has put out the 
          welcome mat for other states to cut the same bad deal.” </p>
          <p class="reg">The state of Utah has a history of seeking rampant RS 
          2477 claims throughout the state. Just last month, Governor Leavitt 
          signed a bill into law intended to give him the ultimate power to 
          determine RS 2477 claims in the state. The Memorandum of Understanding 
          (MOU) released today grew out of a lawsuit threatened by Governor 
          Leavitt in June of 2000. At that time, the state sought to attain 
          recognition of more than 100,000 miles of road claims. </p>
          <p class="reg">“If the Interior Department and the state had truly 
          tried to work out a cooperative agreement that acknowledges only 
          non-controversial, regularly maintained roads, the process and result 
          would have been far different,” said Pam Eaton, the Wilderness 
          Society’s Four Corners Regional Director. “Instead, they have emerged 
          from three years of closed-door meetings with a flawed MOU that 
          doesn’t stand up to a close reading and actually weakens protections 
          for public lands.” </p>
